    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loops\n",
    "- **Lists**: `for item in list:` - iterate through items\n",
    "- **Range**: `for i in range(start, stop, step):` - generate numbers\n",
    "- **Enumerate**: `for i, item in enumerate(list):` - get index and value\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: `for key, value in dict.items():` - get key-value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "### While Loops\n",
    "- **Condition-based**: `while condition:` - repeat while condition is True\n",
    "- **Safety**: Always ensure the condition will eventually become False\n",
    "- **Break**: Use break to exit early if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Control\n",
    "- **break**: Exit the loop immediately\n",
    "- **continue**: Skip to the next iteration\n",
    "- **else**: Runs if loop completes without break\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- Use for loops for known iterations, while loops for conditional repetition\n",
    "- Prefer `enumerate()` over manual index tracking\n",
    "- Use `dict.items()` to loop through dictionaries\n",
    "- Be cautious with `while True:` - always have an exit condition\n",
    "- Consider list comprehensions for simple transformations\n",
