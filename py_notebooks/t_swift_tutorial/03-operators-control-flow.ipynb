    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponent)\n",
    "- **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`\n",
    "- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "- **Membership**: `in`, `not in`\n",
    "- **Identity**: `is`, `is not` (use with `None`, `True`, `False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Flow\n",
    "- **If statements**: Execute code based on conditions\n",
    "- **Elif/else**: Handle multiple conditions elegantly\n",
    "- **Truthiness**: Empty collections, 0, None, False are \"falsy\"\n",
    "- **Chaining**: `x <= y <= z` is more readable than `x <= y and y <= z`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- Use `is` for `None` checks: `if value is None:`\n",
    "- Use truthiness for empty checks: `if my_list:` instead of `if len(my_list) > 0:`\n",
    "- Chain comparisons when possible: `18 <= age <= 65`\n",
    "- Use parentheses for complex logical expressions\n",
