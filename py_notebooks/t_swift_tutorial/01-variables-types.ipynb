    "\n",
    "- **Strings** (`str`): Text data, created with quotes\n",
    "- **Integers** (`int`): Whole numbers\n",
    "- **Floats** (`float`): Numbers with decimal points\n",
    "- **Booleans** (`bool`): `True` or `False` values\n",
    "- **None** (`NoneType`): Represents \"no value\"\n",
    "- **F-strings**: Modern way to format strings with `f\"text {variable} more text\"`\n",
    "- **Type casting**: Convert between types with `str()`, `int()`, `float()`, etc.\n",
